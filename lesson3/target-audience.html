                <br>Name: Clark Hunter <br> <br>
                A nine-year-old kid from Idaho who's scared of thunder. One day he heard from the teachers in his school
                that a thunderstorm may happen a week after. He promised to his parents that he won't be calling them
                anymore if ever he hears a loud thunder because he is a big boys now.

                He wanted to prove that, so he went to browse the internet and was able to get to our website. He saw
                illustrations and videos about thunderstorms. He learned some tips on how to prepare himself in such
                situations.
