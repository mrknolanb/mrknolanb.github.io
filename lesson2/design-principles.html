            <h2>Rule of Thirds</h2>

            <p>The photo used in this website followed the rule of thirds with some balancing element on it. It
                effectively positioned the subject off the center but is also not a big problem for this image because
                the photographer also made sure to utilize some object to fill the empty space.</p>

            <img src="images/plumbersstock.png" alt="a-picture-of-a-bidet-toilet">
            <p>The combination of the text and image with an empty background gave emphasis to the product. Using the
                white spaces has directed the viewer to only focus on the product or the content. It looks clean,
                friendly to the viewer's eyes, and the image was nicely photoshoped.</p>

            <h2>Contrast</h2>

            <img src="images/swplumbing.png" alt="logo-with-a-rocky-mountains">
            <p>The website uses an image as a background. Like many people who struggles to choose a color that allows
                readers or viewers to see both the design and the content easily, this website has done a great job
                using appropriate color background for the text to contrast the background image.</p>
